js in terminal

Far from complete, still in early conceptual stages...

#Why bother?
It is easy to get a js parser for your terminal, but it is without the DOM.
One of the thing I dislike about the DOM is the fact it can be annoying to test it without a browser.

#Is this something for me?
It is unlikely you have any use for this if you don't have any experience in *nx systems.

#Ok, what do I need to know?
Everything will be obvious if you have experience in Linux, JavaScript and preprocessing in C.
If you don't have experience using preprocessor, then don't worry, you will quickly add it to your skillset.
There isn't much commited and the architecture isn't cut in stone yet, so don't worry.

#Ok, what is the plan?
I am working on it. I will see how motivated I will be. Although I like some aspects of JavaScript, it isn't really
my favorite.
